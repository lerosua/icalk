// ChannelStream
// Note: The lifetime of TunnelSession is complicated.  It needs to survive
// until the following three conditions are true:
// 1) TunnelStream has called Close (tracked via non-null stream_)
// 2) PseudoTcp has completed (tracked via non-null tcp_)
// 3) Session has been destroyed (tracked via non-null session_)
// This is accomplished by calling CheckDestroy after these indicators change.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// TunnelStream
// Note: Because TunnelStream provides a stream interface, it's lifetime is
// controlled by the owner of the stream pointer.  As a result, we must support
// both the TunnelSession disappearing before TunnelStream, and vice versa.
